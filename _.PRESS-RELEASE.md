## Micromentoring for JavaScript developers ##
  
  If the word “mentoring” makes you squirm, don’t fret-- there is an alternative. MatchJS fosters meaningful mentoring relationships that are shorter, focused by need, and networked. No one person can do it all – even if they are in the corner office.
  
### Problem ###

  Not everyone has access to a formal mentoring program and not everyone is comfortable with finding a mentor on their own. If you are one of these people, you don't need to let your career suffer. You too can embrace micromentoring!

  On the flipside, not everyone looking to mentor has the time to engage in formal mentorship programs. They may not know where to go to state their availability or who to reach out to. They also may not feel comfortable applying to formal mentorship programs even though they may have a lot to offer and teach.

### Solution ###
  
  MatchJS connects mentees looking to acquire certain skills with mentors who are actively offering up their time to pass on a skill/general advice. Users develop mentoring relationships by need and for only as long as needed.
  
### Features ###
  
  - Identify need: be specific about the advice you are seeking and offering with a Skills Profile.
  - Invite: be direct about your availability with open invitations to mentor.
  - Recommend: get personal recommendations in your inbox based on your skills profile.
  - Communicate: browse and message with other users on the platform.
